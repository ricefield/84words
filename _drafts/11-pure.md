**Scriptures** :

Psa. 73:1 Surely God is good to Israel, / **To those who are pure in heart 25 Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth.**

Matt. 5:8 **Blessed are the pure in heart** , for they shall see God.

2 Cor. 3:16 But **whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away** .

2 Cor. 11:3 But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from **the simplicity and the purity toward Christ** .

2 Tim. 2:22 - But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who **call on the Lord out of a pure heart** .

**Footnotes:**

Matt. 5:8, note 1 **To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory** (1 Cor. 10:31). This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ (John 1:12; 3:6), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (13:19). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. Also, **we need to be pure, single, in our heart that Christ may grow in us without frustration** .

Matt. 5:8, note 2 **If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God** . Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart. This blessing is both for today and for the coming age.

1Tim. 1:5, note 3 **A pure heart is a single heart without mixture, a heart that seeks only the Lord and takes the Lord as the unique goal** …

**Ministry Excerpts** :

Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Second Corinthians 3:16 goes on to say, "But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away." These two verses reveal that in order for someone to see God and receive His shining, the most important thing is that he must either be one who is already not covered in any way, or he must have his coverings removed. **The pure in heart shall see God because they are not covered by anything** . When a veil is put on someone's face, it covers his eyes, but when the veil is taken away, he is able to see the light.

By removing everything that covers him, a person will see light. This is based upon 2 Corinthians 3:16 which reveals that whenever the Corinthians would turn their heart to the Lord, their veil would be taken away. When the heart of the Corinthians was turned away from the Lord, the veil was still on their heart; their turned-away heart was the veil. Whenever the veil was taken away and their heart was turned to the Lord, the Corinthians would receive God's shining. Therefore, the reason man does not receive God's shining is not because God does not shine, but because there is a veil and a covering within man. If man can solve the problem of being covered, then he will see light. Matthew 5:8 says that the pure in heart shall see God, and 1 John 1:5 says, "God is light." Thus, no one can see God without seeing light. God is light, and all those who see light are in God and must be in God alone. **However, the requirement of God is that man must be pure in heart. To be pure in heart means that everything that covers the heart has been removed. Once a person's heart is not pure and has mixture, that mixture becomes a covering. Only the pure in heart do not have any covering; only those who do not have any covering can see light.**

Psalm 73:1 says, "Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart." This is the psalmist's appreciation. In verse 16 he says, "When I considered this in order to understand it, / It was a troublesome task in my sight." However, when he entered into the sanctuary of God, he understood everything (v. 17). So in verse 25 the psalmist declares, **"Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth." This is to be pure in heart.** One who is pure in heart pursues only the Lord in heaven and desires only the Lord on earth. To be pure in heart is to live on this earth desiring only God and to have no desire other than God. When our heart is single and pure toward God, we are those who are without any covering. Hence, the Bible shows us that in order to see the light, it is necessary to remove the covering. (_Pure in Heart_, Chap 2, Sec 1, pp.16-17)

If God wants to work in us but we do not cooperate with Him, He will use some ways to make us willing to cooperate with Him. Here we see that if we want God to work in us, we have to cooperate with Him; otherwise, we are asking for trouble. But what is the way to cooperate with God? First, it is a matter of our heart. **If we want to cooperate with God and allow Him to work in us, first of all we must turn our heart to God, for those who are pure in heart shall see God. A pure heart in the Bible refers mainly to a heart that desires God. The object of those who are pure in heart is God Himself.** They do not want money, position, or beautiful clothing and expensive perfume. They also do not focus too much on their husband or children. Their heart is solely for God. **Matthew says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (5:8); and the Psalms say, "Whom do I have in heaven but You?** / **And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth" (73:25). The pure in heart have a heart so pure that they just want God and nothing other than God.**

Many times we may be perplexed and wonder why those who are pure in heart are often not prosperous, while those who do not love the Lord are often very prosperous. The answer to these questions is made clear when we enter into the sanctuary of God (v. 17). Other people gain only earthly joy and earthly peace, but **the pure in heart gain God Himself** . This is what a clean heart possesses. We have to bear in mind that the reason why God cannot work in us is that our inner being is not clean enough. **It is hard for God to work in us because our heart is not pure. Once our heart is not proper, our focus is also incorrect. This is why the Bible says that whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away (2 Cor. 3:16).** For this reason, it is hard to see God's work in many of God's children. All their problems hinge on whether their heart is on money, on their children, or on God. Judging others does not avail, neither does merely searching the Scriptures. Only turning our heart to God is profitable to us. Some people have half of their heart turned to God, while other people have their heart completely turned away from God. We have to bear in mind that how much our heart is for God determines how much work God will do in us. May we all be those who are pure in heart toward Him. (_Pure in Heart,_ Chap 1, sec 2, pp. 11-13)

**Hymns:**

_ **Hymn 1345** _

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.

So turn your heart to the Lord all the day,

And the veil shall be taken away.

Now the Lord is that Spirit,

And where the Spirit of the Lord is,

There is liberty—such liberty!

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,

The veil shall be taken away.

_ **Hymn 411** _

1Bless'd are the pure in heart,  
For they shall see our God;  
The secret of the Lord is theirs,  
Their heart is Christ's abode.

2The Lord, who left the heavens,  
Our life and peace to bring,  
To dwell in lowliness with men,  
Their pattern and their King.

3He to the lowly soul  
Doth still Himself impart,  
And for His dwelling and His throne  
Chooseth the pure in heart.

4Lord, we Thy presence seek;  
May ours this blessing be;  
Give us a pure and lowly heart,  
A temple meet for Thee.

_ **There are times** _

1. There are times in my lifeWhen my heart is embittered.There are questions unanswered,Yet, You're drawing me

To enter  
Into Your blessed sanctuary  
And turning my eyes heavenward,  
The questions of constant inquiry  
Are changed to these words,

1. "Whom do I have in heavenBut You, dear Jehovah.My flesh and my heartConstantly fail,

But God's still  
The strength of my heart and my portion;  
To Him forever I'll draw near.  
I've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.  
So now throughout the years

1. Turn my view to see You,How I need to see Jesus!!Though I don't understandThe ways that You take;

Lord, make me  
A babe and suckling always praising.  
Enjoying Your worth day by day.  
Let each experience constitute me  
So Your life I'll display  
In every way.
