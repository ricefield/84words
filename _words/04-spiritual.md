## Footnotes

**In her pursuing of Christ the seeker is brought by Him into her regenerated spirit as the Holiest of all (his chambers) to have fellowship with Him** (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1). Our regenerated spirit (John 3:6) as Christ's dwelling place, which is mingled with and indwelt by Christ as the life-dispensing Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22), becomes His inner chambers, His practical Holy of Holies (Heb. 4:16; 10:19), for our participation in and enjoyment of Him as the consummated Triune God.

Through His death and resurrection Christ, as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). **As the all-inclusive consummated Spirit He visits us in our spirit privately, coming to us in a spiritual way, not in a physical way**.
---_S.S. 1:4, note 2_

The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (9:12, 24). **How, then, can we enter the Holy of Holies while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in 4:12**. The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, **whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace.** See note 16<sup>1</sup> in ch. 4.
---_Heb 10:19, note 1_

**A spiritual man is one who denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit, that is, his regenerated spirit, which is occupied and energized by the Spirit of God, to dominate his entire being**. Furthermore, he lives by such a spirit, moving and acting according to it (Rom. 8:4). Such a spiritual person is able to discern the things of the Spirit of God because his constitutional capacity for spiritual perception is able to manifest its function.
---_1 Cor. 2:15, note 1_

I.e., based on. Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must be in spirit. This will keep us from the vanity of religion. See note 9<sup>2</sup> in ch. 1. **The reality of all spiritual things depends on the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit. Hence, the reality of all spiritual matters depends on our spirit,** not on anything apart from our spirit. Whatever is in us is vanity unless it is in our spirit. **Everything that God is to us is in our spirit.**
---_Rom 2:29, note 2_

## Ministry Exceprts

In this message we want to stress the words _private_ and _spiritual_. Christianity preaches the physical Jesus, but we preach the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This One is private and spiritual. **We have seen that the king's chambers signify our spirit. He visits us in our spirit privately, and He comes to us in a spiritual way, not a physical way**. He visits us privately as the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit.

Christ the King brings His seekers into His chambers, that is, into their regenerated spirit, His dwelling place. Let us consider the application of this. When I was young, I was taught to pray to God as the heavenly Father. I was also told not to pray to the Spirit, because in the entire New Testament you cannot find a verse concerning praying to the Spirit. But the more we pray, the more we have the feeling that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us (Eph. 4:6; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9). **According to our experience, our spirit is the Holy of Holies—the dwelling place, the inner chambers, of the Triune God**. In this first chapter of Song of Songs He and we have the private and affectionate fellowship.

The seeker in Song of Songs prayed, "Draw me; we will run after you." Then the king drew her and she followed, but she did not know where to go. The King knows where to go. **We must go to our spirit. The inner chambers of Christ are His lovers' regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11) and are the practical Holy of Holies in Christ's lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God** (Heb. 4:16).

## Hymns

### Hymn 769, ss. 1-7

<pre>
1. To the holiest place I'd come,
    There within the veil to be;
    There to touch the throne of grace,
    Let life's water flow thru me.

2. Now the holiest place of all
    Right within my spirit is;
    Here the Lord in me abides,
    And my spirit joins with His.

3. To my spirit I'd return,
    For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;
    O how marvellous it is!
    He's within, in me complete.

4. Fragrance of the risen Christ
    Thru my spirit may be spread;
    If in spirit I will pray
    Christ will be exhibited.

5. If in spirit Him I touch,
    With His riches filled I'll be;
    Life and light and love and grace
    As a stream will flow thru me.

6. Touching deeply, richly I
    Of Himself experience,
    Thus the law of life I touch
    And His clear anointing sense.

7 In my spirit deeper still
    I would touch the Lord I love,
    Touch Him in His hidden depth
    And His hidden manna prove.

### Hymn 745
<pre>
1. O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
    Who in our spirit lives;
    One spirit have the two become,
    Which oneness to us gives.

2. Thy Spirit with our spirit, Lord,
    The witness ever bears
    That we the Father's children are
    And of God's glory heirs.

3. 'Tis in our spirit Thee we touch
    Thy riches to enjoy,
    And as the Spirit Thou dost give
    Thyself without alloy.

4. 'Tis in our spirit we may walk
    And follow Thee alway,
    While, as the Spirit, Thou dost lead
    And light impart each day.

5. In spirit, by Thy Spirit, Lord,
    We live and worship Thee;
    Thou, in our spirit, thru Thine own
    Strengtheneth constantly.

6. In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord,
    We offer prayer to Thee,
    While, as the Spirit, Thou in us
    Groanest unutterably.

7. We to our spirit would return
    And there would contact Thine;
    'Tis in the spirit we may share
    Our heritage divine.

8. What oneness, O my Lord, is this-
    Two spirits intertwine!
    Thy Spirit in our spirit lives,
    And ours abides in Thine!
